_      The Programme/Project should demonstrate that it is controlling its schedule, and the impact of delays on benefits and cost. The schedule should be baselined at each business case stage and changes to the baseline should be reflected in the costs and benefits of
the project."

2.1,Economic,GATE_2,"Has the project completed a Project Outcome Profile to assess how it will contribute to Government s priority outcomes as
set out in the Public Value Framework?","_      A completed Project Outcome Profile e.g. productivity, carbon emissions, regional increase in Gross Value Added (GVA) etc.
_      A defined plan for driving performance across the lifecycle with well articulated, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress.
_      A defined approach that describes the interfaces with the Supply Chain and how performance
of the Supply Chain will be measured and monitored.
_      Articulated how the project fits into the SNAP model (System, Networks, Assets, Projects) for Infrastructure and how benefits are realised across departments and other stakeholders such as local authorities, combined authorities etc.
_      Peer reviewed economic models should be in place which underpin the projects benefit forecasts.
_      Earned value reporting should be embedded.
_      A project risk register should exist. The project QCRA should be regularly updated to provide an up to date contingency drawdown curve to support monthly progress meetings."
