_      Projects should demonstrate objectives, planning assumptions, constraints, activities and quality plans alongside schedules. Deliverables and milestones should be defined and agreed
for all stages. Detail should be high for the immediate next stage.
_      The Programme/Project should demonstrate that it is controlling its schedule, and the impact of delays on benefits and cost. The schedule should be baselined at each business case stage and changes to the baseline should be reflected in the costs and benefits of the project.",GATE_3

_      A defined plan for driving performance across the lifecycle with well-articulated, measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress.
_      A defined approach that describes the interfaces with the Supply Chain and how performance
of the Supply Chain will be measured and monitored.
_      Articulated how the project fits into the SNAP model (System, Networks, Assets, Projects) for Infrastructure and how benefits are realised across departments and other stakeholders such as local authorities, combined authorities etc.
_      Peer reviewed economic models should be in place which underpin the projects benefit forecasts.
_      Earned value reporting should be embedded.
_      A project risk register should exist. The project Quantitative Cost Risk Analysis (QCRA) should be regularly updated to provide an up to date
contingency drawdown curve to support monthly progress meetings.",GATE_3
3.1,Commercial,"How is the supply chain being incentivised to use emerging digital and manufacturing technologies to achieve for example increased
productivity and whole life requirements?","_      Demonstrating the use of collaborative business models.

4.1,Financial,Are cost estimates robust and benchmarked? How has the programme/project assured themselves that the baseline is credible and how is this implemented?,"_      The cost estimates are underpinned by a bottom-up approach supported by a clear set of signed off assumptions. The Project should demonstrate how the original Cost Model compares to the estimates submitted by the bidders and the Preferred Bidder.
_      The project should demonstrate that cost estimates have been built up using a number of planning and estimating techniques and cost benchmarking. The cost range should be wide at this gate with QCRA at P90.
_      For the largest schemes, it is expected to see independent assurance on the processes used to derive cost estimates plus benchmarking
to validate against national/ international comparators.
_      Regular reports are produced which detail S curves and the project's spend profile, the
reports should also detail risks and proposed contingencies.
_      A top down benchmarking exercise has been completed to validate the cost estimate.
_      There may be benchmarking between suppliers on the scheme or benchmarking between similar national/ international comparators. May include unit cost comparison (e.g. £/ km or per asset e.g. viaducts).
_      A bottom-up benchmarking exercise has been carried out to validate the key rates & pricing. This should also consider indirect costs e.g. overall project management/ oversight.",GATE_3

_      May consider technical assurance to confirm gap analysis has taken place.
